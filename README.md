# Instagram Auto-Reply Bot 

This project is an automated Instagram chatbot built using Python.  
It reads incoming messages from Instagram Web, analyzes the chat history,  
and generates human-like replies using Groq's LLaMA 3.1 Instant model.

Everything (including the AI behavior prompt) is stored in **main.py**  
to keep the project simple.
